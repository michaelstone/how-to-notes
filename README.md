Collection of notes intended for my personal use on things I've come across.

Just in case someone stumbles on this, no guarantees on the accuracy of any of the information as it might just reflect my basic understanding of a topic at the time of writing (use at your own risk). I'd appreciate corrections if there's anything wrong!
